--11.How do you remove the duplicates record of a table?
CREATE TABLE TestDuplicate(

	Age INT
)

INSERT INTO TestDuplicate VALUES (1,'Sam',45)
INSERT INTO TestDuplicate VALUES (2,'Fiona',45)
INSERT INTO TestDuplicate VALUES (2,'Fiona',45)
INSERT INTO TestDuplicate VALUES (2,'Fiona',45)


SELECT * FROM TestDuplicate
-- code below search table for duplicate value(Id) and deletes the rows excessive number of rows so that only one instance of the value is present
DELETE Temp
FROM(
SELECT *
, Duplicate = ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
		PARTITION BY Id
		ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)
		)
FROM TestDuplicate
) AS Temp
WHERE Duplicate >1
